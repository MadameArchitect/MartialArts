Elahi, J., Mangal, R.K., Stead, T.S. and Ganti, L. (2024). A nationwide analysis of upper extremity injuries in martial arts. Orthopedic Reviews, [online] 16. doi:https://doi.org/10.52965/001c.116363 Overview:
This study investigates the prevalence of upper extremity injuries associated with martial arts equipment using data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) over a ten-year period (2013-2022). It aims to enhance the understanding of injury trends within martial arts to better inform equipment design, healthcare provider knowledge, and risk mitigation strategies.

Methodology:
The study utilizes a retrospective design analyzing NEISS database entries related to martial arts injuries to upper extremities. The data spans injuries reported over a decade and is used to understand demographic trends, injury specifics, and annual changes in injury rates.

Key Results:

There were approximately 78,680 injuries reported within the decade, predominantly among men (70.57% of cases).
The most affected age group was adolescents aged 10-19 years.
Shoulders were the most commonly injured part (29.1% of cases), with fractures being the most frequent type of injury (29.2%).
Most injuries (98.7%) did not require hospitalization, indicating a non-severe nature for the majority of cases.
Conclusions:
The study underscores the importance of preventive measures and targeted interventions, particularly for male adolescents, to mitigate the risks of upper extremity injuries in martial arts. It also suggests the potential for improvements in martial arts equipment design to enhance safety.Fong, S.S.M., Ng, S.S.M. and Chung, L.M.Y. (2013). Health through martial arts training: Physical fitness and reaction time in adolescent Taekwondo  practitioners. Health, 05(06), pp.1–5. doi:https://doi.org/10.4236/health.2013.56a3001 Annotation:
This study evaluates the impact of Taekwondo training on physical fitness and reaction times in adolescents. It investigates whether Taekwondo training can effectively improve aspects of physical fitness such as flexibility, muscular endurance, and body composition, alongside improving reaction times.

Overview of Methodology:
The research is a cross-sectional exploratory study comparing 20 Taekwondo-trained adolescents with 20 untrained controls. It involves physical fitness tests like sit-and-reach, leg split test, skinfold measurements, one-minute curl-up test, and ruler-drop reaction time test.

Important Conclusions:

- Taekwondo training significantly improved reaction times but showed no significant impact on flexibility, muscular endurance, or body composition.
- The findings suggest that while Taekwondo enhances certain aspects of physical fitness, specifically reaction time, it may not suffice for overall physical fitness improvements in adolescents.Miller, I., Climstein, M. and Vecchio, L. (2022). Functional Benefits of Hard Martial Arts for Older Adults: A Scoping Review. International Journal of Exercise Science, [online] 15(3), pp.1430–1443.

This scoping review explores the functional benefits of hard martial arts training for older adults, focusing on how such activities could enhance functional fitness parameters like strength, mobility, endurance, and balance.

Overview of Methodology:
The review used a systematic literature search to identify relevant studies, with a critical appraisal of each study using the AXIS Critical Appraisal Tool. It included six studies in the final review, focusing on randomized control trials and comparative studies.

Important Conclusions:

- Hard martial arts training can significantly improve functional fitness parameters in older adults, including strength, mobility, aerobic endurance, flexibility, and balance.
- Despite the positive findings, inconsistencies in training stimulus and limited study numbers suggest the need for further research before making generalized recommendations for older adults.
- Suggested training regimens for beneficial outcomes include sessions of 60 to 90 minutes, at least twice a week for a minimum of eleven weeks.Moore, B., Woodcock, S. and Dudley, D. (2024). Martial arts and school violence: Examining the potential of martial arts training to reduce or foster aggressive behaviour in schools. International Journal of Educational Research Open, 6, pp.100313–100313. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijedro.2023.100313 Annotation:
Overview:
This study, conducted by Brian Moore, Stuart Woodcock, and Dean Dudley, examines the effects of a 10-week martial arts training program on aggressive behaviors in school children. Utilizing a randomized controlled trial, the research aimed to determine if martial arts could serve as a psychosocial intervention to either reduce or potentially increase aggressive behavior in schools.

Methodology:
The study included 283 secondary students aged 12–14 from five urban schools in the Greater Sydney area. The methodology was rigorous, employing a randomized controlled trial design to assess the intervention’s effectiveness on reducing aggression, as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).

Key Results:
The results indicated that the martial arts training did not significantly reduce nor increase aggression among participants. This finding challenges the often-presumed notion that martial arts can effectively regulate aggressive behaviors in adolescents.

Conclusions:
The study concludes that while martial arts training did not exacerbate aggressive behavior, it also did not mitigate it. The authors suggest a cautious approach to implementing martial arts as a behavioral intervention in schools, highlighting the need for further research to explore its potential benefits and limitations more deeply.Pujari, V. (2024). Martial Arts as a Tool for Enhancing Attention and Executive Function: Implications for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy – A Literature Review. Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences, [online] 16(Suppl 1), p.S20. doi:https://doi.org/10.4103/jpbs.jpbs_612_23 Overview:
This literature review by Venkateswar Pujari explores the cognitive benefits of martial arts training, particularly its effects on attention and executive function, and how these can be integrated into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The review discusses the potential of martial arts as a non-pharmacological intervention that might supplement traditional therapy approaches to improve cognitive deficiencies in various psychiatric disorders.

Methodology:
The review synthesizes findings from various studies that examine the impact of martial arts on cognitive functions, specifically attention and executive functions like problem-solving and inhibitory control. It considers both qualitative and quantitative research, including controlled trials and observational studies across different demographics.

Key Results:

Martial arts training enhances attention and executive function, as evidenced by improvements in selective attention and cognitive flexibility.
Incorporation of mindfulness and physical discipline in martial arts training boosts cognitive control and attentional management, which can be beneficial in treating psychiatric conditions such as ADHD and depression.
Studies suggest that the physical activity involved in martial arts promotes brain health, potentially through increased neuroplasticity and improved neural efficiency.
Conclusions:
The review highlights the promising role of martial arts in enhancing cognitive functions and supporting mental health treatments. It suggests that martial arts could be a valuable addition to CBT, enhancing its effectiveness by providing a structured, disciplined approach to improving mental focus and executive skills. Future research is encouraged to explore the specific mechanisms through which martial arts affect cognitive function and to develop targeted interventions that incorporate these practices into broader therapeutic frameworks.Sun, Y., Roza Tabeshian, Mustafa, H. and E. Paul Zehr (2023). Using Martial Arts Training as Exercise Therapy Can Benefit All Ages. Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews, 52(1), pp.23–30. doi:https://doi.org/10.1249/jes.0000000000000326 Overview:
This review explores the comprehensive benefits of martial arts as an exercise therapy across all age groups, emphasizing its potential in improving physical, psychological, and cognitive aspects of health.

Methodology:
The authors review longitudinal studies and cross-sectional analyses concerning martial arts, focusing on populations that include older adults and children with autism spectrum disorder. The review methodically examines how these activities influence balance, muscular strength, and mental health.

Conclusions:
Martial arts offer significant therapeutic benefits that extend beyond physical health, impacting mental well-being and cognitive functions. The authors advocate for its inclusion as a key component in public health strategies, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and children with developmental challenges. This recommendation is based on the accessibility and adaptability of martial arts training, making it a valuable intervention for diverse community settings.Woodward, T.W. (2009).
